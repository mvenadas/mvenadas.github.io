              When you or a loved one is in emotional distress, the pain can be
              unbearable and the need for relief can be overwhelming. At times
              like these you need a professional who is caring, experienced, and
              knowledgeable about your condition. This is exactly what you will
              find when you visit Dr. Sokolski at The Newport Center for
              Behavioral Medicine. With over thirty years of experience treating
              patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders, a background
              in academic and research psychiatry, and extensive training in
              clinical and psychotherapeutic techniques, Dr. Sokolski applies
              the highest level of skill toward correctly diagnosing and
              treating your condition providing the most rapid relief of your
              symptoms whenever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an educator of psychiatric physicians and an academic at the
              forefront of psychiatric research, Dr. Sokolski will thoroughly
              evaluate your symptoms, explain your diagnosis, and clearly review
              potential therapies so that working as a team, doctor and patient
              can develop strategies which will be the most helpful at resolving
              your condition. Because you are viewed more like a family member
              in our office instead of another “case,” your treatment will
              involve an intensive level of caring and devotion on the doctor’s
              part to help you resolve your illness. This includes a genuine
              sense that your wellbeing matters so that all of your concerns are
              addressed and taken seriously. At every stage of your treatment,
              you will be encouraged to ask questions and participate in making
              decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Newport Center for Behavioral Medicine, you will never simply
              be a prescription or a diagnosis as a great deal of importance
              will be placed at each visit in interacting with you,
              understanding you as a person, and evaluating the stresses which
              are affecting you. In addition to your mental health, your
              physical condition will be continuously evaluated, particularly as
              it relates to your emotional symptoms. The concept that wellness
              involves all aspects of your life will always be respected and
              will be a part of your ongoing treatment.
            </p>

            />
            <p class="block pad-top-15">
              As a consequence of our mutual need to interact on an ongoing
              basis, you will be able to contact the doctor when necessary to
              resolve any issues which may arise. Patients often note that
              during treatment through this office, they feel very comfortable
              with Dr. Sokolski and are able to discuss any number of issues
              including family distress, past traumas, job stress, relationship
              difficulties, phobias, and other areas which affect their
              functioning and quality of life. In this regard, appointments
              almost always involve both psychotherapy and medical management of
              behavioral difficulties in order to address environmental stress
              and provide medical therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the valuable interactions which occur at every
              meeting, many patients report that there is an optimism and
              hopefulness that pervades their treatment with Dr. Sokolski. Most
              treated patients improve and many completely resolve their
              symptoms. Dr. Sokolski never gives up on any patient and works as
              hard as necessary toward improving a patient’s wellbeing and
              helping them reach their maximum potential. He is an excellent
              listener and works to address patients concerns rather than
              lecturing them or imposing his ideas on them. He makes
              recommendations, provides the plusses and the minuses of given
              treatments, and helps patients decide which therapy, if any, they
              wish to pursue. The goal through this office is to fully
              understand and as much as possible to determine what is causing a
              patient’s distress and offer well tolerated treatments to relieve
              symptoms as rapidly as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The strategy to achieve this goal is to first meet with new
              patients for one to two hours in order to obtain a thorough
              history including symptoms, past treatments, medical conditions,
              and family history. Records and contacts with past physicians will
              be utilized at this time to solidify a diagnosis. In most cases,
              patients are provided a diagnosis and treatment plan at the
              completion of the first visit. This may include recommendations
              for testing, psychotherapy, and medication.
            </p>

            <p class="block pad-top-15">
              Patients are given contact telephone numbers so that they can
              reach Dr. Sokolski, If needed. In most cases, patients are seen
              for follow-up appointments in two weeks so that treatment can be
              evaluated and adjustments can be made. Once therapy starts to
              improve the condition, many patients who are stable may be seen
              every one to three months. Patients who are stable on therapy
              often continue to do well indefinitely.
            </p>

              Healing from behavioral illnesses is a journey which quite often
              leads to significant, long-lasting improvements. For some the
              changes are life-altering, others achieve a state of wellness for
              the first time, even years after their symptoms first appeared. As
              one of the premier centers for psychiatric treatment in southern
              California, with a wealth of clinical, research, and academic
              experience, The Newport Center For Behavioral Medicine is among
              the most capable and qualified facilities to address all of your
              emotional needs. As the medical director, Dr Sokolski can offer
              you a wealth of experience and compassion toward reaching your
              optimal level of health and wellbeing.
