                It was a miraculous visit to share with your treating
                psychiatrist after a 3+ year absence. A client may not fully
                appreciate his doctor until a period of absence to know his
                effective treatment made a difference in his client's life,
                family's life, and the SMART Community. Hopefully, the stigma
                with effective mental health treatment is not going to hinder
                our diverse, sustainable, and evolving community.

                Great first visit. Dr. Sokolski listened and understood my
                problems and gently explained why and how I might be
                experiencing them and how certain treatments including medical
                and non-medical would work together to help alleviate them.

                He was very nice and informative. he listened to my concerns and
                gave me all of my options to make a clear informed decision.
                They called me to get my appointment the very next day
                vs.waiting till the end of the month. I would recommend this Dr.
                and he made me feel very comfortable too....Thanks Doc!!! I will
                be in to see you again.

                He was fantastic. Really listened to my concerns, did not make
                me feel rushed, took a thorough history, asked a lot of
                questions and then made educated decisions regarding what
                medication(s) to prescribe and explained WHY he was prescribin
                them. He accepted my insurance (Anthem Blue Cross PPO) so all I
                owed was my co-pay. On the way out he handed me his card with my
                next appointment date written on it and said to call anytime if
                I had questions come up between now and the next appointment.
                Extremely satisfied and already feel better about all my
                issues/concerns because it feels as though at least I've started
                to do something about it. Highly recommended!

              <p class="block pad-top-15">
                After a treacherous search for a good psychiatrist for my
                daughter I found Dr Sokolski. My daughter was previously
                diagnosed with depression/anxiety from another psychiatrist and
                it had been a rollercoaster of a year with her. She was
                prescribed numerous meds from her previous psychiatrist and
                nothing was really helping. We were constantly changing meds and
                my daughter was getting to the point where she just didn't want
                to take them cause they just made her feel horrible. My daughter
                was out of control, unstable, and completely unpredictable. My
                stress levels were through the roof and I didn't know what to
                do. I finally realized that this psychiatrist was not the one
                for us. And after hours of research I came across Dr Sokolski
                and decided to make an appointment. Let me tell you.... that was
                the best decision that I have ever made. It was night and day
                from the lady we saw before him. Dr. Sokolski talks to you and
                is great at explaining things to you so that you understand.
                When I first gave him the list of meds that my daughter had
                tried he was shocked at some of the items. He said some of the
                things the other Dr prescribed he did not even like giving to
                adults let alone a teenager. He started her on some new meds
                (which did make an improvement) and shortly thereafter he also
                diagnosed my daughter with ADHD. He started slow with the meds
                cause he knew I was very hesitant about ADHD medication and
                giving my daughter stimulants. ADHD was something new to me that
                I was just learning about and I learned so much from him about
                how it works. He covers all the bases on everything. I thought
                ADHD just meant my kid was hyper! But there was so much more to
                it and my daughter did show all the signs. We started her on
                ADHD medication and it was really life changing. That was the
                complete turning point. Ever since we started seeing Dr Sokolski
                I got my daughter back. She is a normal teenager who is doing
                better in school than she ever has in her life. School has
                ALWAYS been a struggle for her and now she is getting A's and
                B's and is on the honor roll. He is also great about meds when
                it comes to pricing. He knows some of them are really expensive
                and may not be covered completely by insurance. He always has
                coupons and samples of things to help with some of them. My
                daughters ADHD med is only partially covered by my insurance. It
                would still cost me $100 out of pocket but he told me about a
                coupon they have and so now it only costs me $40. I am a single
                mother that pays all of this on my own so I am so appreciative
                of this stuff..
              </p>
              <p>
                The only downside is that Dr Sokolski recently stopped taking
                insurance (my insurance covered seeing him) so now I have to pay
                out of pocket. Yes it's expensive ($175 per visit) but I feel
                like that's an average rate to see a psychiatrist anywhere.
                Luckily my daughter has done so well that I don't need to see
                him every 3-4 weeks like in the beginning. She is now stable and
                we only have to see him every 3 months or so. I could go see
                another Dr thats covered by my insurance but there is NO WAY I
                would take that chance. Dr Sokolski gave us our life back and I
                could not be more grateful to him. Also, Maria at the front dest
                is great! She is always so nice and helpful as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                I only have one regret. Not finding him and seeing him sooner.

                Dr. Kenneth is amazing! He's the best doctor I know. He's
                attentive, caring and always answers all my questions patiently.
                He's helped me a lot in my life and I'm so glad I was referred
                to him by one of my Managers. Also, Maria is so nice at the
                front desk! She's patient and so helpful.

                Doctor Sokolski is the best. I would recommend him to anyone. He
                pays attention to everything I'm saying and he was able to find
                simple solutions to every issue I was experiencing due to my
                mental health. So thankful I found him my quality of life has
                improved ten fold since I began seeing him.

                I have been Dr. Sokolski's patient for 11 years on and off (
                insurance issues). He is a wonderful, caring compassionate man.
                He always will return your phonecall the same day. Love him!!!!

                I almost don't want to write a review because I don't want to
                share! I have had nothing but great experiences with Dr.
                Solkolski. It's is easy to get in with him. In emergencies when
                you need to be seen right away-they absolutely will accommodate
                if they can. He really listens to what you need and makes sure
                you are taken care of. He is worth every penny. I haven't found
                a better Dr., of any kind for that matter. His services blow
                everyone else out of the water. I'm grateful to have found him.
                His secretary is also a huge sweetheart. She's very thorough and
                helpful too. No surprises with them, they let you know what is
                going on with every step of the process. They are exceptional in
                every way way. Highly recommend going there.
